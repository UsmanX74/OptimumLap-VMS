OptimumLap simulation package for Viking Motorsports Electric Vehicle

For an introduction into the package and **current simulation results** have a look at `OptimumLap for EV.pdf` slideshow at https://github.com/podhrmic/OptimumLap-VMS/blob/master/OptimumLap%20for%20EV.pdf 

To get started with your simulation, look at `OptimumLap for dummies (and EEs).pdf` at https://github.com/podhrmic/OptimumLap-VMS/blob/master/OptimumLapfordummiesandEEs.pdf

If you get lost in EE terms, open `EV Handbook.pdf` at https://github.com/podhrmic/OptimumLap-VMS/blob/master/EVHandbook.pdf

`Project` folder includes OptimumLap project file and all necessary files. Included are these cars (all based on our current chassis):
* **Current EV** - Remy motor, 4 battery packs, 200V
* Remy motor, 6 battery packs, 300V
* Emmrax 228 motor, 4 battery packs, 200V
* Brammo motor with Brammo batteries, 150V
* Brammo motor with Brammo batteries **and** Brammo transmision, 150V (basically drivetrain from Empulse motorbike)
* FSAE No Aero IC car (for comparison, average performance)
* FSAE Aero IC car (for comparison, average performance)

And the following tracks:
* FSAE Endurance Nebraska 2012
* FSAE Michigan Endurance 2014
* FSAE Endurance Germany 2012
* FSAE Endurance Germany 2010
* FSAE Autocross Nebraska 2013
* FSAE Autocross Germany 2012
* FSAE Skidpads
* FSAE Acceleration

In `Data` folder are simulation results for endurance at Nebraska track (in csv format, that can be used for example in MATLAB).

Have fun!
